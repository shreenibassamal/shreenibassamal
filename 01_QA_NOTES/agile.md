## 🔹 1. What is Agile?

* **Agile** is a **software development methodology** based on **iterative and incremental development**.
    
* Instead of delivering the whole project at the end, Agile delivers **small, working software pieces frequently** (every 1–4 weeks).
    
* Focus: **Customer collaboration, flexibility, continuous feedback, and quick delivery**.
    

---

## 🔹 2. Why Agile Came?

Before Agile, companies used **Waterfall model**:

* Long development cycle → customer sees product only at the end.
    
* Requirements changed → rework costly.
    
* Testing done at the end → late bug detection.
    

👉 Agile came to **solve these problems**:

* Early feedback
    
* Faster releases
    
* Adapting to requirement changes
    
* Continuous testing + integration

## 🔹 3. When Agile Came?

* Introduced in **2001** through the **Agile Manifesto** by 17 software experts.
    
* Document: Agile Manifesto

## 🔹 4. Agile Manifesto (4 Values)

1. **Individuals & interactions** over processes & tools
    
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
    
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
    
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

## 🔹 5. Agile Principles (12 Principles in Short)

* Deliver software **frequently**.
    
* Welcome **changing requirements**.
    
* **Business & developers work together** daily.
    
* Build around **motivated individuals**.
    
* Prefer **face-to-face communication**.
    
* Working software = **progress measure**.
    
* **Sustainable pace** of work.
    
* Continuous attention to **technical excellence**.
    
* Simplicity is essential.
    
* Self-organizing teams.
    
* Regular reflection & adaptation.

## 🔹 6. Agile Frameworks

Agile is a philosophy; it has many frameworks:

* **Scrum** (most common) → Iterations = *Sprints*
    
* **Kanban** → Visual board for flow
    
* **XP (Extreme Programming)** → Focus on coding practices
    
* **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)** → For enterprises
    

👉 In Automation Testing interviews, **Scrum** is the most discussed.

## 🔹 7. Scrum in Detail

Scrum = Lightweight Agile framework.

### Roles:

* **Product Owner** → Manages requirements (Product Backlog)
    
* **Scrum Master** → Facilitator, removes blockers
    
* **Development Team** → Dev + QA + Automation + Business Analyst
    

### Artifacts:

* **Product Backlog** → List of all features/requirements
    
* **Sprint Backlog** → Subset selected for current sprint
    
* **Increment** → Working software delivered at sprint end
    

### Events:

1. **Sprint** (1–4 weeks)
    
2. **Sprint Planning** → Decide tasks for sprint
    
3. **Daily Scrum/Standup** (15 min) → Team updates: Yesterday, Today, Blockers
    
4. **Sprint Review** → Demo working software
    
5. **Sprint Retrospective** → Improve process for next sprint
    

---

## 🔹 8. Agile Testing (Important for Automation Tester)

* Testing is **not at the end**, it’s **continuous**.
    
* Testers work **in parallel with developers**.
    
* QA is involved in **requirement discussions, sprint planning, and demos**.
    

### Types of Agile Testing:

1. **Unit Testing** → Developers write
    
2. **Automation Testing** → QAs write Selenium/TestNG/Maven/Jenkins tests
    
3. **Exploratory Testing** → Manual testers check unusual flows
    
4. **Regression Testing** → Ensures old features work after new builds
    
5. **Continuous Integration Testing** → Every commit triggers tests in Jenkins

## 🔹 9. Agile Ceremonies for Automation Tester

* **Sprint Planning** → Estimate automation tasks (e.g., 5 scripts)
    
* **Daily Standup** → Share progress: “Yesterday I automated Login, today working on Cart.”
    
* **Sprint Review** → Show automated test reports in Jenkins/Allure.
    
* **Retrospective** → Suggest improvements (like "Automate smoke suite first for faster feedback").

## 🔹 10. Where Agile is Used?

* IT Product Development
    
* IT Services
    
* Automation Testing (Frameworks evolve sprint by sprint)
    
* DevOps + CI/CD
    

---

## 🔹 11. When We Use Agile?

* Requirements are **not fixed** / keep changing.
    
* Customer wants **early releases**.
    
* Teams need **fast feedback loops**.
    

---

## 🔹 12. Prerequisite Knowledge for Agile

* Basics of **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**
    
* Basics of **STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)**
    
* Understanding of **Defect Lifecycle**
    
* Familiarity with **Jira or Azure DevOps** (for backlog, sprint boards)
    
* Knowledge of **Automation Frameworks** (to contribute tests in sprint)

## 🔹 13. Agile in Automation Testing Projects

Example (Sales + Inventory Management project):

1. Sprint 1 → Automate **Login** & **Smoke Test** suite.
    
2. Sprint 2 → Add **Product Search + Add to Cart** tests.
    
3. Sprint 3 → Add **Order & Payment** tests.
    
4. Integrate with **Jenkins + Git + Maven** for continuous execution.
    

👉 By Sprint 3, you already have **working automation regression suite**.
